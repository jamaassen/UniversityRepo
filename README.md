# UniversityRepo
A data repository of courses, students, and instructors.  The system can be used to help students track their required courses, the courses they have successfully completed, their grades,  GPA, etc.

This version is a demo of pulling data from an sqlite DB and displaying it all in a flask/jinja rendered web page.
